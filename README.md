# Virtual-Inscriber

The problem that Virtual Inscriber aims to solve is the limitation of traditional annotations using
mouse or any other hardware device connected to desktop/laptop. Many times these limitations
present a problem for the presenter as it forces the presenter to be stationed at one place near the
computing device for doing annotations. Additionally, these tools often lack the tactile feedback and
natural feel of presenting and explaining, it is human nature to do hand gestures while explaining or
presenting something. Virtual Inscriber seeks to address these limitations by providing a platform for
presentations that is accessible, intuitive, and natural, using machine learning technology to track the
movements of the user's hand and create fluid, natural-looking strokes on a virtual canvas. By doing
so, Virtual Inscriber aims to inspire creativity and exploration, and provide a new and innovative way
for people to express themselves.
